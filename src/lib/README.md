# Library Utilities

Cross-cutting utilities used across the application.

Examples:
- Date formatting and manipulation
- Money/currency formatting
- String formatting
- Validation helpers
- Common utility functions

These utilities should be:
- Pure functions (no side effects)
- Framework-agnostic where possible
- Well-tested
- Reusable across domains
