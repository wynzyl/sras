# UI Components

Reusable UI components that are presentation-only (no business logic).

Examples:
- Buttons
- Tables
- Form inputs
- Cards
- Modals
- Navigation components

Components here should be:
- Composable
- Styled with Tailwind CSS
- Accept props for customization
- Not contain domain-specific logic
